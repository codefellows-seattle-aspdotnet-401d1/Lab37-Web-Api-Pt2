=====================================
	- Took me 2.5 hours
	- I struggled with my POST action when I was rebuilding my lab. During debugging, I removed the ValidateAntiforgeryToken and it worked. I'm not sure why.
	- I learned how to add PUT and DELETE actions to my controller, as well as a GET action that gets all my values. I also learned how to add content negotiation.
    - I utilized my previous lab, the class demo, and the videos.
